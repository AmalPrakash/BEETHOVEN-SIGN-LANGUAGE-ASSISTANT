 SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION USING MACHINE LEARNING
FOR MORE INFO, REFER THE PROJECT REPORT --> Beethoven__Innovative_Sign_Language_Translation_Report

Under development as of 19/7/2020 

It's ok if you wanna give a shot and complete it.. I just effed up at some places.. Some things are faulty as well.. Also, it doesn't predict accurately.. And please do make your own dataset.. Mine is kinda not that pretty.. Happy Coding.

Also don't forget to check on OpenCV Android dependencies..
